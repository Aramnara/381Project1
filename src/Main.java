write a simulation program
customers come need service at a station (single server) anywhere from 0 to 5 min and anywhere from 0 to 8 min is the arrival times between customers. use your program to find the avg amount of time a customer is in the system, the variance of that time, the avg time the server is idle and the variance of this time.

run for 100,000 customers leaving the system.

include debugging output for the first 15 customers leaving the system of their arrival time, their service requirement clock time updates and the queues
